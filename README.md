# royaltypsitechmerger
Replaces psycasts from Royalty with PsiTech's implementation of psionics, while retaining other features of the DLC. Now you can use PsiTech and still have Royalty's non-psitech features without having *two* overpowered psionics systems at once.
  
 If you have feedback, please leave it on github, or in a new discussion on the steam workshop page, or maybe on K's mods discord if K doesn't mind.
